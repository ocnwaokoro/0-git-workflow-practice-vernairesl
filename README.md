# Git Practice

## This article gives a introduction to git as a VCS. It explains the concept of repositories, branches and remote, how to create it, how to commit changes, how to use log, how to add files, remove files, and rename files, how to see the status, how to merge, and  all the basic command and concept of git. This article is really useful for git beginners.

(branch practice by ruocili)
I forgot to create new branch in the fork practice, but I've pushed the changes to someone else's repository already

* This article is similar to mine in that it talks about git commands. I did not like the appearance of the post, but it does explain git well enough for someone to learn from reading it. The article is also interesting for using an analogy about why someone should use git when working on a project.
